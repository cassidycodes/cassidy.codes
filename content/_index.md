Hi! I'm Cassidy, my pronouns are she/her. I am an ever-curious engineer who loves working with teams to build software that people are excited about. New challenges excite me and I work best when I can draw on the expertise of my teammates to work towards a common goal.

Ruby is the language I know best, and I love working in it. My work often focuses on performance improvements and coaching teams in code design choices. In my current role, I guide performance optimization work  and oversee technical decisions for our platform.

When I have time, [I blog on dev.to](https://dev.to/cassidycodes/). I really love it when I get to tackle a challenging problem and then articulate it with documentation or a blog post.
